# WHM-to-WHM Transfer (No Root)

A **simple Bash script** to scan a source WHM server for all **packages** and **accounts/users** under a reseller, without requiring root access.
This script is fully **self-contained** and does **not require `jq`**.

---

## Features

* Works with **reseller WHM credentials**.
* Lists **all available packages** on the source server.
* Lists **all accounts/users** under the reseller.
* Fully **interactive** and prompts for credentials.
* Single file; can be run directly via **curl/wget one-liner**.

---

## Usage

### 1. Run via one-liner

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRabbiRifat/WHM-TO-WHM-TRANSFER-NO-ROOT/main/installer.sh || wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRabbiRifat/WHM-TO-WHM-TRANSFER-NO-ROOT/main/installer.sh)"
```

### 2. Follow the prompts

* Enter **source WHM hostname**, username, and password.
* Optionally enter **destination hostname/FTP** info for future backup support.
